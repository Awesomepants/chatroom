# chatroom

## How to use:

1. Install either mysql or mariadb. This has been tested with mariadb but either should work.
2. Set up a database named "msgdatabase"
3. Give full access of msgdatabase to a user named "chatroom" on localhost with the password "chetroomchetpassword6"
4. Make sure you've installed node and npm
5. Make sure your computer allows traffic on port 5000, otherwise this will only work on your own computer
6. Clone this into your desired repository
7. run npm install
8. run node migration.js (you only need to do this once!)
9. run node server.js every time you want to start the server.
10. Voila!
